    "pricing_strategy": "Edikted uses aggressive 60% discounting from premium anchor prices (£81→£32.40) to create perception of exceptional value while maintaining quality image through 'NotClearance' positioning",
    "trust_building": "Multi-layered social proof (4.8 stars, 32+ reviews, best seller status, multi-platform review integration) rather than single trust signal",
    "urgency_approach": "Subtle, authentic scarcity through popularity signals rather than aggressive countdown timers - better aligned with Gen-Z BS detector",
    "target_demo": "Gen-Z/young millennials (18-28) who are trend-conscious, socially-influenced, price-sensitive but value-seeking, and primarily mobile shoppers",
    "conversion_philosophy": "Visual-first, social-proof-heavy, mobile-optimized experience with minimal friction from discovery to checkout",
    "competitive_advantages": "Clean design, stellar review rating, comprehensive size range, social commerce integration (TikTok/Instagram pixels)",

      "Add above-fold fit guide or measurement tool (address Edikted weakness)",

      "Proactive shipping/returns messaging above-fold (reduce friction)",
      "Video content showing movement/fit (leverage TikTok-native audience)",
